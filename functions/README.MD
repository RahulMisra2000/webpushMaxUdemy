These are the FUNCTIONS on the Firebase.
Think of them as API we have created in FIREBASE

It is fast and quick to create APIs using Firebase using their tools and then pushing the code (called FUNCTIONS by Firebase) to their cloud server. So, we basically code the API as javascript functions on our local PC .. and in one fell swoop using their tools which are npm packages, we push them to the Firebase Cloud server. And that is it !

That is why this folder here is called FUnctions

We could have easily coded in any server side language ... asp.net .. etc .... we would just need to use the appropriate web-push library for that platform... That is all ...


The API is coded in index.js
